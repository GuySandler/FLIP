## Idea:

the pi can run a lot of games + streaming, what if I turn it into a portable console.

I was torn between handheld or DS style, but went with DS because it's compact and I have 2 places to put stuff.

potencial detachable controllers idea.

potencial trackpad

## part reasearch (june 12 1pm-9pm, worked for about 6.5 hours):

### computer
I have pis but they are way too thick with too many IO I don't need

Compute modules exist and look good

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJ2K6F7Q orange pi compute module 4 8gb 64gb storage, 60$, good but pi4 level

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPJWX59Q orange pi compute module 5 4gb 32gb storage, 87$, low storage and ram, expensive

### buttons
I aimed for free shipping

https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804784951471.html 6x6mm buttons, 2.37/2.57$, 20 count

https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808376799054.html 12x12x4.3mm buttons, 2.02/2.22$, 20 count

may need some extra reasearch and I might use some I have

### screens
depending on budget I can go for diffrent quality

https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805985868271.html 5 inch IPS, 25.17/33.83$, 800x480, serial

https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808738957825.html 3.5 inch LCD, 17.64/28.04$ 450x320, with fan, serial in

https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806171406643.html 4 inch LCD, 20.62/24.49$, 320x480, serial, has touchscreen option

https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806072260865.html 3.2 inch IPS, 10.16/10.36$, 240*320, serial

### joystick

I really need to find better ones, all I can find are ribbons and replacements for consoles

87$ on board
~2.5$ on buttons
~1$ on joysticks
~21 on screen
